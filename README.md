Refly is an open-source AI-native creation engine. Refly's intuitive free-form canvas interface combines multi-threaded conversations, knowledge base RAG integration, contextual memory, intelligent search, WYSIWYG AI editor and more, empowering you to effortlessly transform ideas into production-ready content.

## Features

1. **Multi-threaded dialogues:** Refly implements an innovative multi-threaded dialogues mechanism that allows you to freely switch between multiple independent conversation topics. This enables more fluid and natural thought expansion and in-depth discussions, effectively breaking through the limitations of traditional conversations. It helps build complex and effective **Agentic Workflows** in **human-AI collaboration**.
2. **AI-Powered Capabilities:** Leveraging AI models, after inputting a question, users can flexibly select any node on the canvas as context to generate new node content. This includes **AI web search, AI knowledge base search, AI-recommended questions, and AI document smart generation**. It integrates capabilities like Perplexity AI and Stanford Storm into a single workspace.
3. **Context Memory:** Providing precise temporary knowledge base support for each conversation, ensuring the AI model can accurately understand and respond to your questions. Similar to Cursor, you can flexibly select any node in the canvas or add references as context.
4. **Knowledge Base Integration:** Supports importing diverse external resources and intelligently integrating them into the canvas based on your needs. This helps build a comprehensive knowledge system and create a personalized thinking space. With intelligent retrieval technologies like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), you can make semantic queries, making it a true second brain.
5. **Quotes:** Support flexible selection of content from various resources, documents, memos, or skill outputs, allowing one-click addition as contextual references to enhance the accuracy and depth of conversations.
6. **AI Document Editing:** Beyond providing powerful real-time Markdown editing capabilities, it supports intelligent selection of document content and AI-assisted precise modifications and refinements based on your needs, offering you a Notion-like powerful AI editor.

## Quick Start

### Local Development

> Before installing ReflyAI, ensure your machine meets these minimum system requirements:
>
> CPU >= 2 cores
>
> Memory >= 4GB

The easiest way to start the ReflyAI server is to run our docker-compose.yml file. Before running the installation commands, make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine:

```bash
cd docker
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

After running, you can access http://localhost/install in your browser to enter the ReflyAI control panel and begin the initialization process.

> If you want to contribute code to ReflyAI or perform additional development, please refer to our source code deployment guide.

**Next Steps**

For custom configurations, refer to the comments in the [.env.example](https://www.refly.ai/) file and update the corresponding values in your .env file. Additionally, you may need to adjust the docker-compose.yaml file itself according to specific deployment environments and requirements, such as changing image versions, port mappings, or volume mounts. After making any changes, please re-run docker compose up -d. You can find a complete list of all available environment variables [here](https://www.refly.ai/).

### Private Deployment

If you want to configure high-availability setups, there are community-contributed Helm Charts and YAML files that allow deployment of ReflyAI on Kubernetes.

We also want to thank the following open-source projects that make ReflyAI possible:

1. Blocksuite - 💠 The open-source collaborative editor project behind ReflyAI.
2. OctoBase - 🐙 The open-source database behind ReflyAI, local-first yet collaborative. A lightweight, extensible data engine written in Rust.
3. yjs - Provides foundational support for CRDTs in our state management and data sync implementation.
4. electron - Build cross-platform desktop applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
5. React - A library for web and native user interfaces.
6. napi-rs - A framework for building compiled Node.js add-ons in Rust via Node-API.
7. Jotai - Primitive and flexible state management for React.
8. async-call-rpc - A lightweight JSON RPC client and server.
9. Vite - Next generation frontend tooling.
10. Other upstream dependencies.

We're incredibly grateful to the community for providing such powerful yet simple libraries that allow us to focus more on implementing product logic. We hope our project will also provide more accessible knowledge bases for everyone in the future.

## Acknowledgments

"We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us." Many pioneers have inspired us during our development, such as:

- The great "everything is a block" concept from Quip and Notion
- The kanban system from Trello
- No-code programmable datatables from Airtable and Miro
- Infinite visual whiteboards from Miro and Whimsical
- Object-based tagging systems from Remote and Capacities

There is significant overlap in the atomic "building blocks" between these applications. They are not open source, nor do they have a plugin system like VSCode for contributors to customize. We aim to create a tool that includes all the features we love and goes even further.

Thank you for your interest in ReflyAI, and we sincerely hope ReflyAI resonates with you! 🎵 Visit https://reflyai.com/ for more details.
