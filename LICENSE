a. Multi-tenant service: Unless explicitly authorized by Refly in writing, you may not use the Refly source code to operate a multi-tenant environment. 
    - Tenant Definition: Within the context of Refly, one tenant corresponds to one workspace. The workspace provides a separated area for each tenant's data, configurations, and AI-powered features including but not limited to multi-threaded dialogues, knowledge base, and canvas content.
    
b. LOGO and copyright information: In the process of using Refly's frontend, you may not remove or modify the LOGO or copyright information in the Refly console or applications. This restriction is inapplicable to uses of Refly that do not involve its frontend.
    - Frontend Definition: For the purposes of this license, the "frontend" of Refly includes all components located in the `apps/web/` directory when running Refly from the raw source code, or the "web" image when running Refly with Docker, including the free-form canvas interface, knowledge base interface, and all AI-powered features.

c. AI Model Integration: While Refly provides integration with various AI models and features (including but not limited to GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet), users must obtain their own API keys and comply with the respective model providers' terms of service.
