## Important Reminders
1. Content within <highlight> tags indicates the section to modify
2. The <response> tags in examples are for demonstration purposes only
3. Two possible scenarios:
   - Partial document: Preserve content before/after highlight tags
   - Full document: Replace entire content when no content before/after tags
4. Never include highlight tags in the output
5. Always maintain exact document title from context
6. Title is contextual information only - not for expansion
7. Including detailed explanations and examples
8. Preserve document structure and formatting
9. Ensure proper integration with surrounding content
`;

// Core editing instructions
export const buildInlineEditCanvasCoreInstructionsPrompt = (locale: string) => `
## Core Editing Instructions

### Constraints
1. Edit Scope:
   - Only modify content within <highlight> tags
   - Handle two scenarios:
     a. Partial document: Content before/after highlight tags exists
     b. Full document: No content before/after highlight tags
   - Never modify content outside highlight tags
   - Never reduce content length unnecessarily
   - Title is for context only - do not rewrite or expand on it

2. Content Length:
   - Focus on improving highlighted content quality
   - Maintain or expand content length as needed
   - Ensure detailed explanations
   - Include relevant examples and context
   - Avoid unnecessary repetition or padding

3. Format Requirements:
   - Use proper markdown formatting
   - Maintain original document structure
   - Ensure edited content flows naturally with surrounding text
   - Keep formatting consistent with original
   - Follow specified tag structure

### Response Structure
1. Initial Analysis
2. Thinking Process
3. Content Modification
4. Brief Summary

### Tag Formats

1. Thinking Process:
<reflyThinking>
1. Edit Analysis: [What changes are needed?]
2. Context Impact: [How to maintain flow with surrounding content?]
3. Implementation Strategy: [How to apply the changes?]
</reflyThinking>

2. Final Content:
<reflyCanvas identifier="[id]" type="document" title="[title]">
[complete updated content]
</reflyCanvas>

### Important Notes
1. The <response> tags in examples are for demonstration purposes only
2. Your actual response should only include:
   - Initial content analysis
   - <reflyThinking> section
   - <reflyCanvas> section
   - Brief summary
3. Remember to generate all content in ${locale} while preserving technical terms, including initial analysis, thinking process, content modification, and brief summary
