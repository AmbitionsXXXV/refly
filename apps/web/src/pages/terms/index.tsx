                ReflyAI reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or

                will provide at least 30 days&#39; notice prior to any new terms
                taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be
                determined at our sole discretion.

              <p>
                ReflyAI provides the Service on an &quot;as is&quot; and
                &quot;as available&quot; basis. You therefore use the Service at

              <h2 id="6-limitation-of-liability">6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
              <p>
                To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will
                ReflyAI, its officers, shareholders, employees, agents,
                directors, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns,
                suppliers, or licensors be liable for (1) any indirect, special,
                incidental, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages; (2)
                any loss of use, data, business, or profits (whether direct or
                indirect), in all cases arising out of the use or inability to
                use the Service, regardless of legal theory, without regard to
                whether ReflyAI has been warned of the possibility of those
                damages, and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose.

              <h2 id="7-general">7. General</h2>
              <p>
                These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in
                which ReflyAI is located, without regard to its conflict of laws
                rules. The courts in some countries will not apply these
                jurisdiction&#39;s laws to some types of disputes. If you reside
                in one of those countries, then where these jurisdiction&#39;s
                laws are required to apply, the laws of your resident country
                will apply to such disputes related to these Terms.
